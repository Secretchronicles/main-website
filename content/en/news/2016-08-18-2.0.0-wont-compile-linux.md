summary: TSC 2.0.0 wont compile on most Linux distributions
---

As many people have been bringing to our attention, on most modern distributions, or
ones that have compiled their software with the ```-std=c++11``` flag, the 2.0.0 release tarball
has problems compiling. Unfortunately, we released version 2.0.0 right before most
distributions made the change.

There has also been [issue #500 with the game loading to a black screen][2] when compiled
with CEGUI 0.7.9.

We have fixed these issues and many more in the Devel branch of TSC, and are also fixed in
our [alpha][1] builds(which are based on the Devel branch), so feel free to test the game, and
 let us know if you run across any issues.
