summary: Info on our new Domain name
---
Hello all, hope everyone is having a happy holiday.

On behalf of the Secretchronicles team, I am quite happy to announce that we have purchased
the secretchronicles.org domain name, and for the most part we have it fully implemented. We will continue to
have the secretchronicles.de domain for a while yet, but thanks to xet7's hard work, it now redirects to our
new domain.

We are also quite proud to have enabled HTTPS on our site and all of its resources in this process.

If you use email to post to our forum or mailinglist, please update your address book from
`secretchronicles.de` to
`secretchronicles.org`.

Also, if you run into any issues feel free to contact us using your favorite method listed in our [Community page][1].

Have a great holiday!
