summary: The wiki is now live again.
---

Recently, [efforts have started][1] to prepare for a new release of
TSC, 2.1.0, around the beginning of November. This is highly
tentative, but as part of these efforts, the [TSC Wiki][2] has been
re-activated. Said wiki was a set of static pages for years, because
the original solution was heavily abused by spam bots. The new
solution (which, again, uses [Moinmoin][3]) hopefully is set up in a
way that is complicated enough for spam bots to not manage it.

The wiki requires an account to edit, but it's not possible to create
the account on the wiki page itself. Instead, the wiki has been
directly coupled to the [forum/web interface for the mailing list][4], thus
requires to sign up there for an account. This setup allows users
to have a single “TSC account” that grants access both to the forum
and to the wiki.

Everyone is invited to edit our wiki with TSC-related content. Please
contribute! If you have any questions, you can post them on the forum.
