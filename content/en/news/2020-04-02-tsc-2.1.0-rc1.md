summary: First Release Candidate of 2.1.0 has been released.
---

With a delay of some months since the [second beta][1] (which is to be
attributed to the usual free-time constraints of the developers), the
TSC team is pleased to announce the availability of the first Release
Candidate of the upcoming 2.1.0 release for download. The release has
been tagged on the Git repository as v2.1.0-rc1 and has been
uploaded to our web server.

## What has changed since beta-2?

* Small fixes to the build system
* Small fixes to the build documentation
* Added experimental build support for FreeBSD/OpenBSD (GitHub PR [#678][5] by devnexen)
* Finalised the new title theme (GitHub PR [#679][6] by refi64)
* Removed battle.ogg music due to the author requesting removal (GitHub PR [#679][6] by
  refi64)


## Why is 2.1.0 taking so long?

TSC is a project entirely driven by volunteers in their free time. We
all know that free time is scarce. TSC has a massive code base written
in C++ over a course of now more than 10 years, as it builds upon the
original codebase of Secret Maryo Chronicles (SMC). The inherited
code's quality is rather poor and it is difficult to work with this
inherited code.

## When can we expect the final release?

This is the first Release Candidate. If no serious problems are
discovered until 2020-04-11, version 2.1.0 is going to be released
shortly after that date.

## What happens in the RC phase?

The code is now considered to be final for the upcoming release. The
RC phase is the last opportunity to test the game for serious
problems; minor problems will not be fixed. No further changes will be
made that are not related to serious problems. It is not expected that
the game still contains serious problems.

## Can I help TSC as a user now?

You can test the RC1 and see if you find problems that prevent the game
from working. Please report such problems on the [mailinglist][2], the
[forum][3], or on our [bug tracker][4] (requires a GitHub account).

Sadly no new level submissions were made during the beta phase, thus
version 2.1.0 will not contain much different levels from version 2.0.0.
Once version 2.1.0 has been released, we encourage all users to submit
quality levels for inclusion in a subsequent release.
