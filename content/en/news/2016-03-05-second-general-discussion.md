Hello all,
We are working on putting together our second General Discussion.
At the moment, from discussion, we have set the date to hold the discussion in IRC
for April 9th, but the date is still under discussion. 
During this discussion Some of the topics that have 
been brought to our attention for us to discuss so far are as follows:

* Audience and target age group
* Depth of the game's story
* Themes
* Level of the game's "cuteness"
* The naration, scenes, and the game's story text
* Story Submissions
* Translation Websites
* Bug tracker software
* A Life-Energy system

This list is not complete, but it is a starting point. If you have any objections or something you would like
to see changed or added, feel free to contact us either through IRC, the mailing list, or the forum. Also, if 
possible, we would love to see alot of people at the general discussion. If you can make it, please do so! The 
more opinions, the better(usually).

Here are a couple related forum threads/mailing list posts:
[Picking a Date for the Meeting][1] 
[2nd General Discussion, Agenda][2]

Anways, i think that i tackled everything. If you have any questions, as i mentioned above, feel free to contact us. 

Have a great day!
