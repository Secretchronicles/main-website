summary: Alpha Package for Ubuntu 18.04 Available
---

Thanks to Mario(Boospy) from the Github Tracker, we now have a prebuilt 64bit Alpha .deb
package for Ubuntu 18.04. To install it head over to our [Downloads Page][1] to get the
latest package.

To install the package, first cd into the folder where you downloaded the package to:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cd Downloads/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then run:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sudo apt install ./tsc_2.1.0+packagename.deb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apt will take care of the installation and all required dependencies. After the install is finished you can launch TSC through the<br>
new `The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M.` entry in your application menu or by running the `tsc` command in your terminal.

NOTE: You must use apt, not apt-get to install the package, as the older apt-get cannot deal
with installing .deb packages and resolving dependencies from a users home directory. You could
also use `dpkg -i` to install the package, then run `apt-get install -f` to repair the broken dependencies.
