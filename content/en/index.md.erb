What is it?
-----------

_The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M._ (_TSC_) is a two-dimensional
sidecrolling platform game based on [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org)
and [SDL](http://www.sdl.org). The game features a rich set of levels
plus an advanced level editor that allows you to create your own
levels. It is accompanied by a powerful scripting engine that utilises
[mruby](http://www.mruby.org), a minimal implementation of
the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

TSC is a fork of the [SMC](http://secretmaryo.org)
project, whose development has stalled. Note however that our goals
are different from those of the original SMC project, most notably we
are working towards our own type of game rather than being solely
inspired by one specific existing game.
