Welcome to the _Secretchronicles_ homepage. We have not yet decided on
the final name of the game yet, so please take this with a grain of
salt.

We are in the process of creating our first release, so please help by
beta-testing it!

What is it?
-----------

SXC is a two-dimensional sidecrolling platform game based on
[OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org) and [SDL](http://www.sdl.org). The
game features a rich set of levels plus an advanced level editor that
allows you to create your own levels. It is accompanied by a powerful
scripting engine that utilises [mruby](http://mruby.org), a minimal
implementation of the [Ruby programming
language](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

_Secret X. Chronicles_ is a fork of the [SMC](http://secretmaryo.org)
project, whose development has stalled. Note however that our goals
are different from those of the original SMC project, most notably we
are working towards our own type of game rather than being solely
inspired by one specific existing game.
