TSC is a freetime project of several artists, programmers, and many
more people. As thus, these people aren’t paid for the work they do on
TSC, but still the project generates some expenses that need to be
covered, and are currently covered by the people involved from their
own income, which is unfortunate. If you want to show your support to
TSC, please consider making a donation to the project so we can:

* Do contests for great art and music in the game
* Pay bounties for people who fix longstanding bugs or implement
  long-requested features
* Organise physical meetings of the developers (travel expenses)
* Buy hardware for testing the game, for backups, or anything else
  that requires physical equipment
* At least pay the people from the core team a small sum for their
  sustained support of the game
* And many things more. In any case, it is always good to have a
  little bit of savings in case unexpected costs arise.

The project lead tries to maintain maximum transparency regarding the
money that is received from donations, and the team decides as a whole
about how any received money is to be spent. Be assured we are very
grateful for any donation to this project.

TSC is too small currently for receipt of nonprofit organisation
status under German law, so sadly, we cannot grant a donation
certificate for your donation. Please consider what this means to your
local tax volume before you donate.

Payment info

### Bank transfer

The main TSC bank account is an ordinary SEPA bank account located at
a German bank that you can transfer money to from any bank that
supports international bank transfers. Beware that the account is set
up for Euro, so that your bank might charge conversion fees if your
own account’s currency is different.
