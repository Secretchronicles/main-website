title: TSC Documentation
---

These pages link to the various pieces of documentation regarding
TSCâ€™s. The *C++* documentation documents the internal workings of TSC,
which are only interesting for TSC developers. The *Script Core*
documentation contains the level scripting API as defined by the
underlying raw C++ functions that is available in each level script
without further action. The *SSL* documents the additional libraries
that are shipped with TSC for scripting purposes that are built on top
of these core functionalities in pure Ruby, and that need to be
included by means of `TSC.require`.

The most recent version of this documentation can be generated from
the TSC source tree by the `rake docs` command.
