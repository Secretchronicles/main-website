IRC Channel
-----------

The IRC channel [#secretchronicles on
freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/secretchronicles) is the main
discussion hub of the project; many discussions start here before they
make it to the “tsc-devel” mailinglist mentioned below. More often
than not, one or two of the core team are online here.

You can join the channel via [Freenode’s
webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=secretchronicles), but
that one is known to sometimes fail or be unavailable and is
uncomfortable to use. Therefore, it’s recommended you use a native IRC
client like [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) instead, which also
integrates much better with your operating system.

The channel is logged with the [channel
logs](https://chatlogs.secretchronicles.org) being publically
available on our website.

Mailinglists
------------

There are two mailinglists on which the public discussion of the
project happens:

* [tsc-users](https://lists.secretchronicles.org/postorius/lists/tsc-users.lists.secretchronicles.org/)
  is where users talk about TSC, e.g. to share their levels.
* [tsc-devel](https://lists.secretchronicles.org/postorius/lists/tsc-devel.lists.secretchronicles.org/)
  focuses on the development of TSC.

Forums
------

The mailinglists mentioned above can also be accessed via web forums
if you prefer to not use email:

* [User Forum](https://lists.secretchronicles.org/hyperkitty/list/tsc-users@lists.secretchronicles.org/)
* [Developer Forum](https://lists.secretchronicles.org/hyperkitty/list/tsc-devel@lists.secretchronicles.org/)

Anything you post to that forums is mirrored to the respective
mailinglist and vice-versa.
