TSC is an open-source project. As such, it is entirely driven by the
participation of its community members. Their discussion happens on
the following media, which you are invited to join at any time if you
have a question about TSC or want to contribute.

Mailinglist
-----------

The mailinglist is the best place to engage if you aren't patient
enough for IRC (see below). If in doubt, post here.

* [tsc-devel](https://lists.secretchronicles.org/postorius/lists/tsc-devel.lists.secretchronicles.org/)

Forum
-----

The mailinglist mentioned above can also be accessed via a web forum
if you prefer to not use email:

* [Forum](https://lists.secretchronicles.org/hyperkitty/list/tsc-devel@lists.secretchronicles.org/)

Anything you post to that forum is mirrored to the mailinglist and vice-versa.

IRC Channel
-----------

The IRC channel [#secretchronicles on
freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/secretchronicles) is the main
discussion hub of the project. Usually someone is online, but as a
small free-time project, this cannot be guaranteed. If you post here,
please be aware that in the worst case it can take hours until
somebody responds. If on the other hand somebody is online, you might
get an answer within minutes. Don't hesitate to mention one of the
channel operators to make them aware of your presence.

You can join the channel via [Freenode’s
webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=secretchronicles), but
that one is known to sometimes fail or be unavailable and is
uncomfortable to use. Therefore, it’s recommended you use a native IRC
client like [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) instead, which also
integrates much better with your operating system.

The channel is logged with the [channel
logs](https://chatlogs.secretchronicles.org) being publically
available on our website.
