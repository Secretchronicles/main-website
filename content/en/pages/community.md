Mailinglist / Forum
-------------------

There are two mailinglists, “tsc-devel” (focusing on the development
of TSC) and “tsc-users” (where users talk about TSC). Both can be
accessed and subscribed to at
[https://lists.secretchronicles.org](https://lists.secretchronicles.org). That
website also includes a forum-like web interface that allows you to
read the mailinglists and post to them without having to use email.
