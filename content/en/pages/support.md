Transparency
------------

TSC is a freetime project of several artists, programmers, and many
more people. Commercial Support payments will be used to:

* Implement features, fixes etc which have been ordered
* Do contests for great art and music in the game
* Organise physical meetings of the developers (travel expenses)
* Buy hardware for testing the game, for backups, or anything else
  TSC game related
* Saving for unexpected costs

The project lead maintains maximum transparency regarding the
money that is received from Commercial Support with reports at [forum][1],
and the team decides as a whole about how any received money is to
be spent. Be assured we are very grateful to all
Commercial Support customers to advance the TSC game development.
